# Cookbook

Welcome! Browse the recipe categories:

- [Soups](/soups/) – e.g. borsht
- [Starch](/starch/) – rice variations
- [Sweets](/sweets/) – pumpkin puree

Each Markdown file in these folders will be rendered by Jekyll automatically. If you want cleaner permalinks later, we can convert these folders into collections by renaming them with a leading underscore and adding collection config.

## Updating
Just push changes (new or edited `.md` files) and GitHub Pages will rebuild once Pages is enabled.
