# Pumpkin seeds 

**You'll need**

* Pumpkin seeds (fresh from a pumpkin or store-bought raw ones)
* Olive oil or melted butter
* Salt
* Optional spices (cinnamon sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika… go wild)

## Step 1: Clean 'em

If they're fresh from a pumpkin:

1. Separate seeds from the goop (a little patience goes a long way here)
2. Rinse in a colander

Drain well.

## Step 2: Season

Pat seeds dry-ish. They don't need to be perfect.

Toss with:

* A drizzle of oil or butter
* Salt + whatever seasoning you're into

## Step 3: Roast

Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet.

Bake at **350°F (175°C)** for **12–18 minutes**, stirring halfway.

You want:

* Light golden brown
* Crispy edges
* Not soggy

Let cool. They crisp more as they cool!

## Flavor ideas

* **Savory**: garlic powder, paprika, salt, black pepper
* **Spicy**: chili powder, cayenne, lime zest
* **Sweet**: cinnamon, nutmeg, a lil sugar, drizzle of maple after roasting
* **Everything bagel seasoning** is also great
