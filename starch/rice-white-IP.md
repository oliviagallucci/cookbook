# White Rice - Instant Pot 

### 🍚 Basic White Rice (Jasmine/Basmati)

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup rice (rinsed until the water runs mostly clear)
* 1 cup water
* Pinch of salt (optional)
* 1 tsp oil or butter (optional, helps prevent sticking/foam)

**Steps**

1. Rinse your rice — yes, really. It keeps it fluffy, not gluey.
2. Dump rice + water (+ salt/oil if using) into Instant Pot.
3. Close lid, set valve to *Sealing*.
4. Press **Pressure Cook** (or Manual) → **High** → **4–5 minutes**.
5. Let it **natural release for 10 minutes**, then vent.

Fluff with fork.
