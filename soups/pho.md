# Noodle-less Pho - Instant Pot

Also known as "no-noodle base pho."

**Serves:** 2–3
**Time:** ~35 minutes

## What you'll need

* 1 small yellow onion, halved
* 1 thumb-size piece ginger, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, smashed
* 4 cups chicken broth (or veg broth)

* [Pho powder]({{ '/assets/images/pho-powder.jpg' | relative_url }}) (thanks, Weijia!) OR spices:
  * 1 cinnamon stick
   * 2-3 [star anise]({{ '/assets/images/star-anise.jpg' | relative_url }})
   * 4–5 [whole cloves]({{ '/assets/images/whole-cloves.jpg' | relative_url }})
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste

* Toppings 
  * 8–12 oz Bean sprouts
  * Lime wedges
  * Jalapeño or chili slices
  * Cilantro & green onion
  * Thai basil 
  * Thinly sliced onion
  * Sriracha & hoisin

Optional: 

* 1 lb chicken thighs or breast (or sub tofu for veg)
* 1 tbsp fish sauce (or soy sauce/tamari for veg)(add after tasting)
* 1 teaspoon granulated white sugar (Swerve) (depends on powder)

## Instructions

1. **Char aromatics**

* Set Instant Pot to sauté
* Dry-roast onion & ginger cut-side down until slightly charred

Do this for around 1 minute. 

2. **Dump everything in**

* Add chicken and broth
* Spices or pho powder (1 tablespoon)
* Salt + sugar + fish sauce (just initial amounts)

Tip: whisk powder into broth a bit so it dissolves.

3. **Pressure cook**

* High pressure **15 minutes**
* Natural release **5 minutes**, then quick release

4. **Taste + adjust**

* Needs more savory taste? → add fish sauce
* Needs more warmth? → a pinch more pho powder
* Too salty? → splash more broth or water
* Needs roundness? → little bit sugar

5. **Build your bowl**

* Add toppings to bowls
* Pour hot broth over to soften vegtables a bit

### Flavor trick

Add a squeeze of lime + a few torn cilantro leaves in the bowl even if you're not doing full toppings.
