# Crustless pumpkin pie 

## What you'll need

* 1 can (15 oz) [pumpkin purée](pumpkin-puree) or make your own pumpkin puree 
* 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk
* 3 large eggs
* ¾ cup sugar (or ½ cup sugar + ¼ cup brown sugar for extra yum) - I use Swerve (monk fruit) sugar.
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* ½ tsp ginger
* ¼ tsp nutmeg
* ¼ tsp cloves (optional)
* ½ tsp salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to **325°F (160°C)**.
2. Grease an **8-inch pie dish** or similar baking dish.
3. Whisk together pumpkin, sugar, spices, and salt.
4. Add eggs, mix well.
5. Stir in evaporated milk + vanilla until smooth.
6. Pour into dish.
7. Bake **50–60 minutes**, or until the center is just set and a knife comes out mostly clean.
8. Cool completely. It sets as it cools.
9. Chill at least 2 hours for best texture.

## Tips / ideas 

* **Water bath:** Place the pie dish inside a larger pan, add hot water halfway up sides; get velvety texture.
* Add **2 tbsp flour or cornstarch** for extra structure
* Top with whipped cream or Greek yogurt + maple drizzle.
* Could make high-protein twist
